    {
        "question": "Q9. What are immutable and mutable data types?",
        "answer": "A.In Python, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This means that you can\u2019t change the value of an immutable object once it is created. Examples of immutable objects in Python include numbers (such as integers, floats, and complex numbers), strings, and tuples."

This is true regardless of the underlying distribution of the population from which the sample is drawn. This means that even if the individual data points in a sample are not normally distributed, by taking the average of a large enough number of them, we can use normal distribution-based methods to make inferences about the population."

        "answer": "A.A chi-square test of independence is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It is used to test the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent, meaning that the value of one variable does not depend on the value of the other variable."
    },
    {
        "question": "Q37. What is the significance of the p-value?",
        "answer": "A.The p-value is used to determine the statistical significance of a result. In hypothesis testing, the p-value is used to assess the probability of obtaining a result that is at least as extreme as the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the predetermined level of significance (usually denoted as alpha, \u03b1), then the result is considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected."

        "question": "Q41. What is the difference between feature selection and extraction?",
        "answer": "A.Feature selection is the technique in which we filter the features that should be fed to the model. This is the task in which we select the most relevant features. The features that clearly do not hold any importance in determining the prediction of the model are rejected."

        "question": "Q43. What is the difference between linear and nonlinear regression?",
        "answer": "A.Linear regression is the method used to find the relationship between a dependent and one or more independent variables. The model finds the best-fit line, which is a linear function (y = mx + c) that helps in fitting the model in such a way that the error is minimum considering all the data points."
    },
    {
        "question": "Q44. How will you identify underfitting in a model?",
        "answer": "A.Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but one common cause is that the model is too simple and is not able to capture the complexity of the data."

    {
        "question": "Q45. How will you identify overfitting in a model?",
        "answer": "A.Overfitting in a model occurs when the model learns the whole training data instead of taking signals/hints from the data and the model performs extremely well on training data and performs poorly on the testing data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Q46. What are some of the techniques to avoid overfitting?",
        "answer": "A.Some techniques that can be used to avoid overfitting include cross-validation, regularization, pruning (in decision trees), and simplifying the model."

    {
        "question": "Q54. How do you decide whether a model is suffering from high bias or high variance?",
        "answer": "A.If the model performs poorly on both training and testing data, it has high bias (underfitting). If it performs well on training data but poorly on testing data, it has high variance (overfitting)."
